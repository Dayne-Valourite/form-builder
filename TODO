☐ Rename Builder Folder to Support
☐ Move Resources into support --> See how bolt does it
☐ Add more fields
☐ Extract custom code into own createModel page, as well as inject schema for form selector into model creation schema
☐ Maybe store the user that has filled the form in?
☐ How do we handle a form that gets updated and then a model viewed, do we update the form_content and then display the new form?
☐ Cache the form components that gets generated so we can reuse inside the generator?
☐ Label should auto populate from the name field inside the field repeator --> if not set, we get label from name
☐ Neaten up the infolist to make use of created_at and updated_at in a better spot
--> If users see a nice infolist, they might not want to redo it

☐ Make the form infolist, and table schema better

☐ It makes logical sense to rename Form to FormBuilder and FormBuilder to Form, as we extend FormBuilder currently which is weird, we should extend
☐ form and then let formBuilder be the resource?

☐ Extract common code, like meta components
☐ Model to appear and indicate to the user that the form has been updated and ask them if they want to use the new version or not
☐ Add more options into the meta data to be saved
☐ File Upload needs to be coded in

☐ Change form_id to id

☐ Radio does not work

☐ Meta data
--> required
--> prefix icon
--> prefix
--> suffix
--> prefix icon colour
--> required

☐ We do not default on a config
