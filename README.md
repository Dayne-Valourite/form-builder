```php
$table->json('form_fields')->nullable();
```

3. **Configure allowed models** in your `config/form-builder.php`:

```php
'models' => [
    App\Models\Client::class,
    App\Models\Project::class,
],
```

4. **Go to your Filament admin panel** â†’ Navigate to the **Forms** resource â†’ Create a form â†’ Assign it to your model (e.g., `Client`).

5. The form data will be stored in the `form_fields` column on each model instance.
